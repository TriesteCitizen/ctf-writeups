In this challenge we probably have to recognize some phishing attack or recognize some attack patterns through phishing. After setting up the virtual environment we access a URL that looks like this

<img width="930" height="943" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99ad3a7f-857f-453c-8bc8-e2b294629d80" />

So we have to check 10 realistic email examples and recognize if they are real threats or if they do no harm. Let's get started.

## First email
<img width="938" height="500" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49f1d29a-40c3-4db0-ac49-8c47d6a9d35e" />

This is a phishing attempt as sensitive information are requested from us, like banking details. 

## Second email

Yet again this is a phishing attempt. A deceptive domain is used to mimic a payment portal

## Third email
<img width="931" height="504" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91b67c64-70b4-4067-908d-041716e1f160" />

And once again, we have a phishing attempt, which redirects us to a malicious password reset page

## Fourth email
<img width="933" height="504" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bbe46df-2bdb-458a-b1b0-ccdf17fe19b4" />

Here we have a phishing attempt, in which we are asked to enter a link and enter personal credentials.

## Fifth email
<img width="931" height="285" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73023a8e-01f8-4bb9-8efb-8b18a5f9e79f" />

This is NOT a phishing attempt.

## Sixth email
<img width="918" height="378" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc059070-995a-4fbe-993d-317dcbb3c622" />

This is a phishing attempt as there are attachments we are tasked to download and enable macros.

## Seventh email
<img width="918" height="378" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c98ceb2b-078c-46e4-b186-57db47760c0b" />

The sender domain is a look-alike. Usually it would be microsoft.com, but this site is called rnicrosoft.com. Clear case of phishing.

## Eigth email
<img width="922" height="359" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2aa9908-416e-47e0-819c-481947a38548" />

This is also a phishing attempt as it contains a suspicious third-party survey link.

## Ninth email
<img width="924" height="377" alt="Bildschirmfoto vom 2025-11-19 14-10-32" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cc2c0d4-1ca8-402f-b6c6-0e2940457647" />

This is phishing as the sender is using casual language.

## Tenth email
<img width="924" height="377" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/973e6703-17fd-438f-a078-939020e806d6" />

This is also a very classic phishing attempt. The offer requires us to reveal sensitive personal or banking details.

## Eleventh email
<img width="923" height="279" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed1ed547-0cf3-4fb6-80d2-a941bfb2dac1" />

This isn't a phishing attempt. Just a normal email.

<img width="892" height="437" alt="Bildschirmfoto vom 2025-11-19 14-17-16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab849df3-bc71-4eb5-b985-0852bf9f2710" />

And with that we beat the box. It was a fairly short one. I did several attempts, ~~because I was naive~~ because I really wanted to see what different kind of phishing emails one could face. It was fairly entertaining and really showcases that the biggest weakness really will be the human.

## Lesson Learned
The lesson that was learned in this box was the determining and recognizing of various tactics used in phishing emails and develop skills to recognize indicators of these threats. The understanding is crucial for enhancing cyber security awareness and defensive strategies.
