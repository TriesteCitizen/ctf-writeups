# 🛡️ ctf-writeups

Welcome to my personal CTF archive. This is where I will document my progress in regards to platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox. This is purely for educational purposes and to enforce my learnings.

## ⚔️ Attack Vectors
- Reverse-Engineering
  1. check permissions (change them with chmod 777/chmod +x if not executable)
  2. run application
  3. strings
  4. ltrace
  5. Ghidra (Decompiler)
  6. check for hexadecimal value and if we can convert to ascii or decimal
- Blue Teaming 🔵
  - Pyramid of Pain (1. Hash values | 2. IP-Addresses | 3. Domain Names | 4. Network/Host Artifacts | 5. Tools | 6. TTPs
- IT-Forensic
  1. Filter protocols (http.request.method=="GET", given protocol)
  2. Check TCP stream
  3. Look for interesting files (.exe, .zip, passwords etc.)
  4. If stream contains zip file --> save tcp stream as raw and unzip
  5. Volatility tool if we need to handle dmp/vmem files (look up Cheat sheet)
  6. VirusTotal
  7. Check hashsum of specific sha1sum file.txt
  8. Look for reports on specific libraries
  9. when analyzing pdfs -> use editing tools (e.g. LibreOfficeDraw)
  
- Check Page Source
  1. for client-side written JavaScript code that should be written on the server side and can be exploited (Authentification Bypass)
  2. for hidden messages
- Scripting
  1. See source code examples for different scenarios (Scripting.md)
- OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
  1. Inspect picture
  2. Wayback machine
  3. check social media sites / alternative usernames
  4. check commits
- Gain access to a Windows machine through Linux -> rdesktop IP-ADDRESS
  1. View < Hidden Items
  2. Change Permissions: Right Click < Properties < Security < Edit < "everyone" < OK < Apply
  3. Power Shell 
- Esoteric Programming Languages
- png (Check header information through hex dump)
- Security through obscurity (tools: binwalk / StegOnline)
- Spectography ( https://academo.org/demos/spectrum-analyzer/ )
- Steganography (steghide (with given password) and stegcracker) 
- Use decryption tools and Hash Analyzers (ROT, Vigenère Cipher, md5/4)
- SQL Injection
- Network Inspection
- Web Shells (malicious script that can be uploaded to a web server)
- Brute Forcing (with tools like hydra into FTP or SSH (e.g. Agent Sudo))
- Port Knocking when ports are given
- DNS enumeration with dig or nslookup
  1. For mail server checking: dig givemetheflag.com MX
  2. For text record checking: dig givemetheflag.com TXT
  3. For general information about a domain: dig dig @10.10.240.191 givemetheflag.com
- nmap -p- -sV -A
  1. Check version of software by browsing too. Can it be exploited? https://www.exploit-db.com/ 
- curl (-A to specify User-Agent. -L to follow any redirects)
- Command Injection (modify payload according to given program/check for environment variables)
- (PHP/Bash) Reverse Shells ( https://www.invicti.com/learn/reverse-shell/ )
- Tools for Enumeration (with hidden directories. Always choose your wordlist carefully and in context to the situation. "/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt" is a good pick in most cases)
  1. gobuster (for appending specific strings we can also add a -x flag at the end to clarify a specific one)
  2. hydra
  3. Metasploit
  4. Nikto
- robots.txt
- SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
  1. Check for any hidden server, where crafted requests from a vulnerable server to internal or external resources can be done using Burp Suite (url parameter can maybe be modified) 
- Does the webserver host multiple websites?
  1. If yes -> add that domain name to the etc/hosts file with the IP-Address
- LFI (Local File Inclusion) https://www.hackthebox.com/files/cheatsheet-file-inclusion.pdf
  1. PHP Wrappers (e.g. http://mafialive.thm/test.php?view=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/development_testing/test.php) -> then analyze source code
- In Shell:
  1.if www-data user: Check configuration files in /var/www/html or other useful phps that get mentioned in the configuration file that could have sql credentials
  2. mysql -u <username> -p
  3. SHOW DATABASES; | USE <DATABASE>; | SHOW TABLES; | SELECT * FROM <TABLE>; etc.
- boot to root
  1. SUID binaries
  2. sudo -l (list of all commands the user can run as sudo)
  3. sudoers file
  4. Enumeration (check for backup files in var (log_history)
  5. check loghistory (RCE through Docker)
  6. sudo
  7. cronjob vulnerability
  8. always check the permissions. We might still be able to access or read specific directories and files
- CyberChef
- GTFOBins

## 📌 Final Remark
- The solutions are **self-acquired** and document **my approach**
- I only post solution of retired machines or publicly available challenges
- Some of these write-ups may be a little long winded and need to be cut down. As I am at my humble beginnings I tend to write down a lot of details to remember for the future. Hopefully this is a skill that will improve over time
- There may are write-ups that I will return to, because there are several attack vectors for specific challenges and I'm only showcasing one type of it. The more knowledge I will gather the more I will try to experiment with what I'm given.
