This challenge will be more focused on Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering. This room will introduce me to several topics within Image Intelligence and geospatial intelligence (IMINT/GEOINT) and teach me:
1. Getting into the right mindset and how to be analytical
2. Visually extracting key data points from an image or video
3. Applying different tools to assist me in geolocation and answering context questions

After this room we should be able to apply tools and methodologies to geolocate and answer context questions based on visual intelligence alone. Let's get started

## Your first challenge
For our first challenge we are advised to not make use of any tools yet. We should just use our eyes to scan the image for important information. Extracting key data points from the image will allow me to apply the right tool, craft a good Google search or identify which part of the world the image might have been taken in.

According to Geoint expert Benjamin Strick there are 5 elements that we should consider when looking at an image.
1. Context
2. Foreground
3. Background
4. Map markings
5. Trial and error

There may be some clues in the source of the image we can make use of. For the following challenge we need to find out the name of the street where the following image was taken
<div align="center">
  <img width="666" height="446" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b6dd680-3864-43b7-ab63-c8e101660a32" />
</div>
The picture itself clearly already reveals to us, what the name of the street is. I skipped all this text and immediately went on using internet tools, which IS a possibility, but how the task itself already hinted, sometimes results can be gathered more quickly by taking a good look at things ourselves. Anyway just look at the sign at the center and you should have a pretty good idea where we are.

## Just Google it!
Now we are starting to get introduced to different tools. Google in this instance. If we see anything in the image that can be extracted into a keyword, phrase, a company name, telephone number or any other question we may have as a result of scanning the image up and down we should google it. We get explained the art of 'dorking', where Google search queries return spcific types of data. With the given image we now have to answer several questions.
<div align="center">
  <img width="666" height="446" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bbd0e88-2bfd-48de-8fc8-ae5a88f4c5f3" />
</div>
The first question is asking about which city the tube stations is located in. This was still fairly easy, as I visited the city a long time ago. It obviously has a lot of common identifying features and shouldn't take that long to figure out.

The second question asks about which tube station these stairs lead to. This is where the use of google gets helpful. When doing a quick search query with the initials google does the heavy lifting.

<img width="1522" height="959" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a32aef8-4aa4-496c-b3d6-7147652b087e" />

The third question asks us which year the station opened. As we already know the name of the station from the last question, we can move on and do a search query that reveals the year for us too now. Wikipedia gives us a lot of insightful information about the history of this station and also reveals the opening year, as well as the number of platforms.

## Keep at it!
The challenges are getting a bit more difficult now. We still need to do some dorking to get the information we need. 
<div align="center">
  <img width="478" height="266" alt="Bildschirmfoto vom 2025-11-20 14-44-50" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73785c54-51b1-4b84-bedd-409c9d23d725" />
</div>
Clearly the images we are seeing are also getting more ambitious. The only hint we have is the big sign that says 'YVR CONNECTS'. When googling we already get all the information we need though. The wikipedia page answers ALL the questions that we have.

The first question asked us which building this picture was taken in. It's the Vancouver International Airport which resides in Canada, Richmond.

## Coffee and a light lunch
Now we need to locate a coffee shop. The only hint we have is that it's somewhere in Scotland and two pictures that are supposed to help us out in our endeavors.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc593d06-a7c6-4f54-944b-93e18fa7b39b" width="40%" />

</p>

I really thought that the first picture would be a clear indicator on what kind of city we would deal with, but Edinburgh wasn't the right answer. I was already about to brag how I was there and would know about this, but I had to do a deep dive here. I googled for all the stores that are located in Scotland and finally found a place that looked similar to the one I was seeing.

<img width="1490" height="863" alt="Bildschirmfoto vom 2025-11-20 17-18-02" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/274d4442-1ff0-4475-b831-f1c06a158a9a" />

The same stairs and facade. We found the right store and the city and street with it.

For the second question we have to figure out the name of the coffee shop, which we are looking at the store from. I first confused the coffee shop with the Cartwheel Inn, but shortly after that we found the right place

<img width="1848" height="965" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd1fc53a-9343-4b30-b742-3848db1c125c" />

The rest information of the store were found after searching for it on google

<img width="483" height="799" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c92c8f4-e664-4e06-8f5a-b4306b3a66be" />

The first two browser results also helped in filling in some open holes.

## Reverse your thinking
One of the methods for geolocating an image is to do an image reverse search. This means we are searching for the image itself online, and if the image has been indexed by search engines we may find the exact image or we can do a visual search or crop search to help us find similar images. The picture we have to do this for is the following
<div align="center">
  <img width="336" height="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c0218a4-7689-4ff4-87a0-80db69e8f848" />
</div>

We took that picture and just inserted in google. We immediately get the results we are looking for.

<img width="1307" height="726" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7a9ddb2-f82f-48d7-b77b-2692803fec2d" />

We can do a more thorough search now by using the name of the restaurant

<img width="1391" height="921" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b712f9ed-b423-4d4a-ae28-3d5cc6678110" />

Now we only need to find out the name of the Bon Appétit editor that worked 24 hours at this restaurant. 

<img width="1031" height="278" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a9e82a3-1812-4089-a029-0c275da86b5c" />

Bullseye! We got the answer.

## Locate the sculpture
This challenge will require us to apply all the beforementioned techniques that we acquired with this picture

<img width="2048" height="1536" alt="task7_1602636111226" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c075038b-227e-4903-8429-b7e821470b32" />

Let's do a reverse search again.

<img width="1306" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ac96bb2-98dd-439d-97be-965d0ab42636" />

Ta-da! With that we have half the information we need. The next question was a bit more tricky. Largely due to the fact that the website we were supposed to look at didn't exist anymore. When asking the question in the web browser it gave me the answer by naming a write up as a resource, which most definetely is not the intended way of finding out these information, but it's nonetheless one valid option, especially if the other given options are not available anymore.

<img width="1306" height="400" alt="Bildschirmfoto vom 2025-11-20 18-10-04" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9285a49a-40ba-442e-a68b-f6a5a21a244b" />

## ...and justice for all
This challenge will be a step up in difficulty and I'm not expected to solve this quickly. Here we have to revise our thinking and approach while working on solving this challenge. Here the picture we have to analyze.

<img width="915" height="612" alt="task8_1603365958159" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03781c09-b769-40df-b259-54fabb38105a" />

At first I thought reverse searching would be the way to go, but I quickly realized what "revising our thinking" would mean in this context. I asked for the full name of the statue as Justitia didn't seem to work.

<img width="1033" height="945" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6421465f-099f-4b0a-9d11-e55b32af6884" />

And we got our answer. I had to give another name, but I was close.

Now we had to find out the exact location of said statue. Yet again reverse searching didn't seem to give any insights at first. I even hoped for some sort of database where you could look up a list of all statues that were ever made of the Lady Justice, but that also didn't help. Out of desperation I browsed through all the articles until I found one newsletter, which finally gave an answer.

<img width="1007" height="908" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e02cf4c2-7c70-4106-a03b-8f141e579b2d" />

Now the last question was asking what the building opposite of said building would be. With our knowledge about the city I looked up the courthouse on Google maps and checked out what was opposite of the statue.

<img width="544" height="459" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ff798f2-4aab-4b29-806f-376ca8b7942a" />

Problem solved!

## The view from my hotel room
This one shocked me the most, because now we had to work with a video snippet. To be fair it gave a very good insight and a lot of clues with which we could work on. For example this building.
<div align="center">
  <img width="1715" height="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a827fca2-c039-454f-aafa-70e7937f18db" />
</div>
You know for a fact I would use this to my advantage. There were also a lot of colorful buildings we could see and this building
<div align="center">
  <img width="1715" height="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35ad2f7b-0b0b-4b11-98cb-c321a43f505a" />
</div>
There also was this building which seemed super familiar. I can't quite put it together though I'm sorry, I feel like I should know this
<div align="center">
  <img width="1715" height="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89aac4fb-b5ff-43b7-a3f4-edf3bda9f5ce" />
</div>
and some sort of ferris wheel...
<div align="center">
  <img width="1715" height="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24e42c22-08b0-4684-9d6d-b5abed42a791" />
</div>
Now the final question asks us what the name of the hotel was that this video was recorded at.

I just started to look for the Riverside Point and quickly deduced that the videos had to be taken in Singapur.

<img width="1419" height="900" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cae94eab-5bcf-4fc2-ae84-e2edac8d859d" />

Now I just tried to use Google maps to trace the steps back to the hotel. Standing in front of the hotels should be those colorful houses.
<div align="center">
  <img width="1718" height="966" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0c48086-175f-48d9-8f57-e452b7a76801" />
</div>
A park is also nearby. These are more than enough hints to get us going. I did a very long search. Honestly this was quite a painful process. I went through all the hotels that could have been possible. This shouldn't have been as difficult as it was. After a long search the only hotel that came into question and that stood in front of Clarke Quay was one. It was impossible to find though, as it seems like that hotel is permanently closed now. Maybe I could have found this out easier through tools, so I might look at this with a tool some other time.

## Lesson Learned
