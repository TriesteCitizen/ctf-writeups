# üõ°Ô∏è ctf-writeups

Welcome to my personal CTF archive. This is where I will document my progress in regards to platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox. This is purely for educational purposes and to enforce my learnings.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Attack Vectors
- Check Page Source
- CyberChef
- Security through obscurity (tools: binwalk / StegOnline)
- Spectography ( https://academo.org/demos/spectrum-analyzer/ )
- Steganography (steghide (with given password) and stegcracker) 
- Use decryption tools and Hash Analyzers
- SQL Injection
- Brute Forcing
- Command Injection (modify payload according to given program/check for environment variables)
- (PHP/Bash) Reverse Shells ( https://www.invicti.com/learn/reverse-shell/ )
- Enumeration (with hidden directories)
- boot to root
  1. SUID binaries
  2. sudoers file
  3. check loghistory (RCE through Docker)
  4. sudo
  5. cronjob vulnerability

## üìå Final Remark
- The solutions are **self-acquired** and document **my approach**
- I only post solution of retired machines or publicly available challenges
- Some of these write-ups may be a little long winded and need to be cut down. As I am at my humble beginnings I tend to write down a lot of details to remember for the future. Hopefully this is a skill that will improve over time
- There may are write-ups that I will return to, because there are several attack vectors for specific challenges and I'm only showcasing one type of it. The more knowledge I will gather the more I will try to experiment with what I'm given.
