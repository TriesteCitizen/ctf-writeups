# 🛡️ ctf-writeups

Welcome to my personal CTF archive. This is where I will document my progress in regards to platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox. This is purely for educational purposes and to enforce my learnings.

## 📌 Final Remark
- The solutions are **self-acquired** and document **my approach**
- I only post solution of retired machines or publicly available challenges
- Some of these write-ups may be a little long winded and need to be cut down. As I am at my humble beginnings I tend to write down a lot of details to remember for the future. Hopefully this is a skill that will improve over time
- There may are write-ups that I will return to, because there are several attack vectors for specific challenges and I'm only showcasing one type of it. The more knowledge I will gather the more I will try to experiment with what I'm given.
